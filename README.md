Visualizing Meteorite Strikes on a Map

Meteors are chunks of rock that hurdle through space. Often, they come close to earth's orbit, and we see them streaking across the night sky as shooting stars. They usually burn up in our atmosphere, but if they survive and impact the ground they become meteorites. The data set contains the names (yes they name meteorites), locations, year of discovery, mass, and information about whether the fall was observed.


This Processing sketch ingests the CSV data, and places the meteorites on a map. The area of the circles is directly proportional to the mass of the meteorite. The largest meteorite in this data set, the Hoba meteorite, is 60 million grams and is located in Namibia. The smallest meteorite, Yamato 8333, is a mere 0.01 grams and is located in Antarctica.
